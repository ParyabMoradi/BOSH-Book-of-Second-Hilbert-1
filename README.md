## ✨ Story

A brilliant student known as The Second Hilbert solved all of Hilbert’s unsolved problems and documented them in a mysterious book.
Before he could publish his work, he was murdered, and the Book of Second Hilbert was stolen by a secret organization.

Two of his classmates—siblings of a dying mother—are offered a deal by their mentor:

“Retrieve the book, and I’ll help you decrypt it to claim the Hilbert Prize. The reward will pay for your mother’s treatment.”

The players embark on a high-stakes heist to steal back the book, only to discover that their mentor’s intentions may not be as pure as they seem...

## ⚔️ Gameplay
🎭 Phases

Before the Book – Players focus on combat and survival.
After the Book – Players must protect the book while continuing to fight and solve puzzles.
Each stage tests teamwork, timing, and strategy as enemies grow stronger and mechanics evolve.


## Core Mechanics
🎨 Combat

Enemies have randomized color-coded click sequences.
The girl paints the enemy with the correct color.
The boy attacks using his spell sequence.
Missing or attacking too early breaks the combo.

## 📚 Protecting the Book

After retrieving it, players take turns carrying the book.
The book has durability—if destroyed, the mission fails.
Players can drag and drop the book using the mouse within a time limit.

## 🧩 Cooperation & Puzzles

Many platforms and devices require coordinated color activation.
Some obstacles can only be overcome by alternating between abilities.
